## What Is Trinitarianism?

The Adventist Church has a poor record of accurately understanding and
teaching the traditional doctrine of the Trinity. Many of its early
pioneers rejected Trinitarianism because they believed it was a
perversion of the truth about God.[^1]

Joseph Bates rejected Trinitarianism because he thought that it taught
that the Son is identical to the Father: "Respecting the trinity, I
concluded that it was an impossibility for me to believe that the Lord
Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, was also the Almighty God, the
Father, one and the same being."[^2]

J.N. Loughborough considered Trinitarianism "pagan and fabulous,"
writing, "It is not very consonant with common sense to talk of three
being one, and one being three. . . . If Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are
each God, it would be three Gods; for three times one is not one, but
three."[^3]

J.H. Waggoner argued that Trinitarianism undermines the Adventist
atonement doctrine by maintaining that only Christ's human nature died:
"Trinitarians hold that the term 'Christ' comprehends two distinct and
separate natures: one that was merely human; the other, the second
person in the trinity, who dwelt in the flesh for a brief period, but
could not possibly suffer, or die; that the Christ that died was only
the human nature in which the divinity had dwelt. . . . Thus the remark
is just, that the doctrine of a trinity degrades the Atonement, resting
it solely on a human offering as a basis."[^4]

In each case, these pioneers rejected Trinitarianism because they
misunderstood how it distinguishes three persons of the Godhead. They
imagined that Trinitarians differentiate the Father, Son, and Holy
Spirit by their actions or vocations. However, the Nicene Creed, which
is the traditional formulation of Trinitarian orthodoxy, distinguishes
the divine persons not primarily by their *vocations*, but by their
*origins of procession*. It states that the Son was "eternally begotten
of the Father," but is nonetheless "of one Being [consubstantial] with
the Father," and that the Holy Spirit "proceeds from the Father and the
Son."[^5] "Begetting" and "sending" are thus the proper verbs used to
distinguish the divine persons.

In his *Summa Theologica*, Thomas Aquinas explained procession by noting
that people have two mental faculties: intellect (thinking) and volition
(willing). Both are "processions" because these faculties *proceed*
toward a particular kind of object represented in the mind. The
intellect proceeds toward what it believes to be true, while volition
proceeds toward that which it desires or loves. Intellection and
volition are distinguished by our mind's different relations or
processions toward mental objects, although these objects may be the
same.[^6]

Aquinas states that the Father's generation or "begetting" of the Son
and the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father and Son correspond
to God's intellection and volition of himself, respectively. In other
words, the Son is God's intellection of himself (his understanding of
himself) and the Holy Spirit is God's volition of himself (his desire or
will to actualize himself). The Son and Holy Spirit are intrinsic to the
Father because they are processions in his mind. Because the Father's
intellect and will never change, the Son and Holy Spirit proceed
eternally from his omniscient and omnipotent essence. God is
*omniscient* precisely because the Son is eternally generated from the
Father: his omniscience consists not only in his knowledge of all
created beings but in his eternal knowledge of himself. Likewise, God is
*omnipotent* because the Holy Spirit eternally proceeds by the mutual
volition or love of the Father and Son: God's omnipotence consists not
only in his power to create anything he wants but in his eternal power
to actualize himself through his will.[^7]

Nevertheless, Aquinas explains that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are
distinct persons. They are not anthropomorphic "persons" possessing
independent abilities or mental faculties. (Because they are one, they
cannot disagree, and each person can do everything the others can.)
"Person," when used to describe God, means a self-subsisting relation
belonging to God's essence. The Son is self-subsisting (he exists
necessarily) because God cannot be conceived except as understanding
himself. Likewise, the Holy Spirit is self-subsisting because God cannot
be conceived except as eternally actualizing his will. Since God's
nature necessarily involves his intellection and volition of himself,
these intrinsic processions are as self-subsisting as the Father, who is
unoriginated (neither begotten nor sent). Although there is an order of
procession among the divine persons, there is no order of priority
(either temporally or hierarchically) among them. They are coeternal and
coequal, proceeding by equal necessity from God's eternal and infinite
nature, and it is senseless to speak of the "eternal subordination" of
one to the other.[^8]

## How the Pioneers Misunderstood Trinitarianism

Aquinas states that we can only know these intrinsic processions in
God's mind because he has revealed them to us in the scriptural
tradition. Apart from the Bible, which has named these persons and their
processions, we would have an inadequate conception of the Trinity,
since we would be modeling our understanding of these processions on
human faculties.[^9]

This was Bates' mistake: by basing his understanding of the Son's
generation from the Father on human procreation, he imagined it was
impossible to identify the Son with the Father, just as we cannot regard
human children as identical to their parents. Bates didn't understand
that when God begets himself through his intellect, the resulting
person---the Son---is still intrinsic to the Father (they have the same
nature), whereas human children have different natures than their
parents. Rather than taking God the Father's relation to the Son, as
revealed in scripture, as the standard of paternal relations, Bates took
human fathers' relations to their children as the standard and then
projected this standard onto God.

Likewise, when Loughborough considered it nonsensical "to talk of three
being one," he was right to suppose that we cannot distinguish the
divine persons through human reasoning alone. We tend to distinguish one
thing from another by considering their external relations (such as
their physical boundaries) with other things. However, the relations
among the divine persons are internal to God and therefore invisible to
us apart from divine revelation. We can only accept Trinitarianism by
faith in the scriptural tradition, through which God has revealed
himself to us.

Waggoner mistakenly assumed that the Son is distinguished from the
Father by his vocation rather than by his origin of procession. He
imagined that what primarily distinguishes the Son from the Father is
that he became a human and died to obtain our salvation. However,
Trinitarianism teaches that the eternal generation of the Son from the
Father, and not the Son's soteriological role alone, is what makes the
Son distinctive. When we affirm that Christ is the Son of God, we are
affirming that Jesus is God's incarnate intellection of himself and that
we can know God through faith because God's self-understanding has
become an embodied, historical entity. Christ achieves our salvation by
revealing God's selfless love for us. His death was not a "human
sacrifice," not only because Jesus was no mere human, but because
salvation comes through Christ's resurrection rather than his death
alone. God comprehends himself, in the person of his Son, as a selfless,
loving being whom death cannot defeat because he exists by eternal
necessity. Christianity teaches that salvation is participation in God's
eternal life through faith in Christ, in whom God became a historical
reality.

## Avoiding the Pioneers' Mistakes

Unfortunately, the 28 Fundamental Beliefs have not adequately corrected
the early Adventist pioneers' mistakes. They do not sufficiently convey
that the divine persons ought to be distinguished not by their vocations
but by their origins of procession. Consequently, many Adventists,
wrongly distinguishing the divine persons by their roles, have concluded
that the Son is eternally subordinate to the Father rather than coequal
with the Father. (They believe this hierarchy is the model for the
relationship between men and women.) Moreover, some Adventists, fearful
of anything superficially resembling "spiritualism," deny that the Holy
Spirit is a distinct person, regarding him as simply the life animating
the Father---as though God consists of an inseparable body and soul like
people. They believe that the Spirit is simply God acting in his
capacity as a living entity. Both errors result from the mistaken view
that the persons of the Godhead are or ought to be distinguished by
their activities or vocations.

To correct these mistakes, I'd like to propose several amendments to the
Fundamental Beliefs that would better align Adventist doctrine with
Trinitarian orthodoxy.[^10]

**Fundamental Belief 2 ("The Trinity").** I would modify the first
sentence of this doctrine to say, "There is one God: Father, Son, and
Holy Spirit, a unity of three coeternal, *coequal, and consubstantial*
Persons, *differentiated by intrinsic relations of procession that are
essential to God's nature*" (the italics indicate the added portions).
This would indicate that the divine persons are essential to God's
nature and that there is no order of priority among them.

**Fundamental Belief 4 ("The Son").** First, I would modify the first
sentence of this doctrine to say, "God the eternal Son, *who is
eternally generated from the Father through God's intellection of
himself*, became incarnate in Jesus Christ." This expresses what is
distinctive about the Son, specifically the kind of procession that
distinguishes him from the Father and Holy Spirit.

Second, to clarify that the Son was not begotten by the Holy Spirit,
instead of saying, "He was conceived of the Holy Spirit," I would modify
this to say, "*His human body* was conceived of the Holy Spirit."

Third, rather than saying that Jesus "perfectly exemplified the
righteousness and love of God," I would say that he "*revealed* the
righteousness and love of God." This is to avoid suggesting that the
Father and the Son have distinct wills or that Jesus could have not
exemplified God's love and righteousness, which is impossible.

**Fundamental Belief 5 ("The Holy Spirit").** First, I would modify the
first sentence to say, "God the eternal Spirit, *sent by the will and
mutual love of the Father and Son*, was active in Creation, incarnation,
and redemption." Here, I have omitted that the Spirit was active "with
the Father and the Son," as though they are autonomous entities. This
expresses what is distinctive about the Holy Spirit and clarifies his
relation to the other persons of the Godhead.

Second, I would modify the second sentence, "He is as much a person as
are the Father and the Son," to clarify what "person" means in the
context of the Godhead, such as by saying, "He is as much a person, *or
a relation subsisting in God's nature*, as are the Father and the Son."

Third, I would omit the sentence, "He filled Christ's life with power,"
since the power of the divine persons is the same and the Bible also
attributes Christ's power to the Father (see John 5:19).

**Fundamental Belief 9 ("The Life, Death, and Resurrection of
Christ").** I would omit the phrase "In Christ's life of perfect
obedience to God's will," because it suggests that Christ's will was
distinct from the Father's. Rather, I would say, "*Because the Father
and the Son have the same will, the incarnate Christ perfectly revealed
God's goodness and love. Through Christ's* suffering, death, and
resurrection . . . ." (The additional benefit of this amendment is that
since the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, who have the
same will, it guarantees a more coherent understanding of the Holy
Spirit.)

I also recommend modifying any other Fundamental Beliefs that implicitly
suggest that the Son's will is distinct from the Father's or that the
Son is eternally subordinate to the Father.
